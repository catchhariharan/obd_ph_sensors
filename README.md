# obd_ph_sensors

This project aims at integrating OBD ELM 327 sensor data and Android Phone sensors such as accelerometer, magnetometer and Orientation meter in a PYQT display

The project is developed in Python script and PYQT. For getting Android phone information QPython is used in phone side.
The initial script is taken from another github project https://github.com/Pbartek/pyobd-pi

The Logic is written to find out the suggested gear for manual transmission vehicle, along with some other features.

It is still a unfinished project, trying to calculate Compass and Pitch and roll from raw sensor data. Also other features from the OBD could be used to arrive some predictive analysis data for the end user.
